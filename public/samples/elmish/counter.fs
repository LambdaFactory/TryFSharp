module Elmish.Counter

(**
 The famous Increment/Decrement ported from Elm.
 You can find more info about Emish architecture and samples at https://elmish.github.io/
 NOTE: The API in Fable's REPL may differ from Fable.Elmish & Fable.React nuget libraries.
       The generated JS code won't be as optimized as when using dotnet-fable.
